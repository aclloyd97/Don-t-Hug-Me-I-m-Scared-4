# Don't Hug Me I'm Scared, The Computer Song

## [Red Guy]
Huh, I guess it's my turn to choose a card. Let's see..."What is the biggest thing in the world?"

## [Duck]
Hmm...that's a tricky one

## [Yellow Guy]
A mountains...a sky...a windmill?

## [Duck]
No!

## [Red Guy]
If only there was a way to learn more about the world

## [Duck]
Yes! If only there was some way to learn more information about this...

## [Yellow Guy]
Wow, look!

## [Computer]
I'm a computer, I'm a computery guy
Everything made out of buttons and wires
I'd like to show ya inside my digital life
Inside my mind there is a digital mind


## [Red Guy]
Oh, maybe you could help us answer this question; "What is the biggest thing-"

## [Computer]
Clever, I'm very clevery guy

## [Yellow Guy]
Wow!

## [Computer]
Count to a 50 in the blink of my eye
And print a picture, and then I tell you the time

## [Duck]
Time?

## [Computer]
Help you to find something you're wanting to find
No, it's easy to be a clever smart boy like me
If you could to it all digitally-yyyyyyyyyy!

## [Yellow Guy]
Wow! I'd like to be as smart as a computer

## [Red Guy]
Actually, we already have a computer

## [Computer]
Great, great news!
Now before we begin our journey
I just need to get some information from you!
What's your name?
Where do you live?
What do you like to eat?

## [Duck]
I live in my house

## [Yellow Guy]

## [Computer]
Great news!
Now just a few more questions and we'll be on our way!

## [Red Guy]
Wait a second...

## [Computer]

## [Computer]
Do you like cows' or goats' milk?

## [Red Guy]

###### [a mishmash of digital noise and screams occurs as several dark scenes flash]

## [Computer]
Welcome to my digital home
Everything made out of numbers and code

## [Yellow Guy]
Whuh?

## [Duck]
Wow, we're all computery!

## [Red Guy]
Oh yeah!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
This is a computer

## [Yellow Guy]
I don't get it
How can it be
If I'm sitting at home when I'm inside the screen?

## [Computer]
But you're not you!
You're your digital you!
Virtually real, but controlled by real you

## [Duck]
But if he's not quite real, then I'm not real, too!
And your not real you is inside your real you!

## [Red Guy]
Oh, wow, how amazing and interesting, too
In this digital world, what can we do?
What can we do?!

## [Computer]
Hey, good question!
Well, it's up to you
In the digital world, there's only three things to do

## [Yellow Guy]
Wow, look, a pie chart!

## [Duck]
Digital style!

## [Computer]
Do the digital dancing
Hey, this is fun!

## [Yellow Guy]
Wow, look, a bar graph!

## [Duck]
Digital style!

## [Computer]
Do the digital dancing
Hey, this is fun!

## [Yellow Guy]
Wow, look, a line graph!

###### [the speed quickens up until it's a blur]

## ["real" recording]
Now you're stupid one
I am going to paint a picture of a clown
My dad has a computer
You are not invited to the party

## [Red Guy]
Wait, what?

###### [his head pops]
